angular-azure-blob-upload
=========================

AngularJS service for uploading and downloading to azure blob storage. Provides for the ability to upload and download an HTML5 File to Azure's Blob Storage. 

The file is uploaded in chunks to avoid memory issues as a BlockBlob. 
The download is made with "XMLHttpRequest" to provide events so it could not work on old browsers.

It uses a Shared Access Signature (SAS) to secure the file upload.

Required dependencies
-----------------------
* [AngularJS] (http://www.angularjs.com) 

Add the Azure Blob Upload to your index.html file 
```HTML
<script src='/client/js/lib/azure-blob-upload.js'></script>
```

After downloading the `azure-blob-upload.js` to your AngularJS project then

Add `'azureBlobUpload'` to your main angular.module like so
```javascript
angular.module('myapp', ['myApp.controllers', 'myApp.services', 'azureBlobUpload']);
````

How to use
-------------
Add the azureBlob service as a dependency to your controller like so:
```javascript
angular.module('myapp')
  .controller('MainCtrl', ['$scope', 'azureBlob', function ($scope, azureBlob) {
  ...
}])
```

##### UPLOAD
This will expose the following method to upload:

* azureBlob.upload(config)

The config object has the following properties

```javascript
{
  baseUrl: 		// baseUrl for blob file uri (i.e. http://<accountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blobname>),
  sasToken: 	// Shared access signature querystring key/value prefixed with ?,
  file: 		// File object using the HTML5 File API,
  progress: 	// progress callback function,
  complete: 	// complete callback function,
  error: 		// error callback function,
  blockSize: 	// Use this to override the DefaultBlockSize,
}
```

##### DOWNLOAD
This will expose the following method to download:

* azureBlob.download(config)

The config object has the following properties

```javascript
{
  baseUrl: 		// baseUrl for blob file uri (i.e. http://<accountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blobname>),
  sasToken: 	// Shared access signature querystring key/value prefixed with ?,
  file: 		// File object using the HTML5 File API,
  progress: 	// progress callback function,
  complete: 	// complete callback function,
  error: 		// error callback function
}
```

CORS
-------------

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) must be enabled on the azure blob storage account. The following articles can assist with this...

Special Thanks 
-------------

Extreme thanks goes to Gaurav Mantri and his original work using plain JavaScript. Much of it comes from the blob post...
(http://gauravmantri.com/2013/02/16/uploading-large-files-in-windows-azure-blob-storage-using-shared-access-signature-html-and-javascript). I took his original code from here and turned it into a re-usable angular service.
